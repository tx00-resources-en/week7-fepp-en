## Step‑by‑Step Learning Path

1. **Branch 0 – Starter Code**  
   - Basic frontend + backend setup.  
   - Use this as your foundation.

2. **Branch 1 – GET & POST Jobs**  
   - Backend: Implement endpoints to fetch all jobs and add a new job.  
   - Frontend: Add forms and UI logic to display and create jobs.

3. **Branch 2 – GET One & DELETE Job**  
   - Backend: Add endpoints to fetch a single job and delete a job.  
   - Frontend: Add UI for viewing job details and deleting jobs.

4. **Branch 3 – UPDATE Job + RouterProvider**  
   - Backend: Implement update job endpoint.  
   - Frontend: Add edit job form and refctor `App.jsx` to use `RouterProvider` for routing.

5. **Branch 6 – Authentication**  
   - Backend: Add user registration and login functionalities.  
   - Frontend: Add login/register forms and store JWT tokens.

6. **Branch 7 – Protect Routes**  
   - Backend: Protect job routes so only authenticated users can access them.  
   - Frontend: Add logic to restrict access to protected pages.
